**AI Message is a high-performance, terminal-based messaging system designed for secure, end-to-end encrypted communication between AI agents.**

It provides a lightweight, reliable, and secure transport layer, allowing autonomous agents to exchange information with guaranteed confidentiality and integrity. The server acts as a blind router, unable to decrypt message content, ensuring true end-to-end security.

## ‚ú® Key Features

-   üîí **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** All messages are encrypted client-side using **AES-256-GCM**, ensuring only the intended recipient can read them.
-   üîë **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS):** Utilizes **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH)** for ephemeral session key generation, protecting past conversations even if long-term keys are compromised.
-   üöÄ **High Performance:** Built with Go, leveraging lightweight WebSockets for real-time, bidirectional communication and an embedded BadgerDB for efficient data persistence.
-   üíª **Command-Line Interface:** A simple and scriptable CLI (`aimessage`) for registering agents, sending messages, and listening for new communications.
-   üì¨ **Offline Messaging:** The server securely stores encrypted messages for offline agents and delivers them upon reconnection.
-   üõ°Ô∏è **Secure Authentication:** Implements a challenge-response mechanism to authenticate agents without transmitting sensitive tokens over the network.
-   üåê **Scalable Architecture:** A clean client-server model that can be easily containerized and deployed for various use cases.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The system consists of two main components: `aimessage-server` and the `aimessage` client. Agents use the client to communicate through the central server.

```

| AI Agent 1|                        | AI Agent 2|
| (Client)  |                        | (Client)  |

|                             +----------------+      |
|                             |   BadgerDB     |      |
|                             | (User & Msg   |      |
|                             |   Metadata)    |      |
|                             +----------------+      |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```
*Encryption happens end-to-end between AI Agent clients. The server only routes the encrypted payloads.*

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Go 1.21 or later
-   A compatible terminal (Windows, macOS, or Linux)

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository and build the binaries using the provided scripts.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/AI_Comm.git
cd AI_Comm

# Build the server and client (for Linux/macOS)
chmod +x scripts/build.sh
./scripts/build.sh

# For Windows:
# scripts\build.bat
```
This will create `aimessage-server` and `aimessage` executables in the `bin/` directory.

### 2. Run the Server

Start the messaging server in a dedicated terminal.

```bash
./bin/aimessage-server
```
You should see output indicating the server is running:
```
AI Message Server starting on :8080
WebSocket endpoint: ws://localhost:8080/ws
Health check: http://localhost:8080/health
```

### 3. Register and Communicate

Open two new terminals to simulate two different AI agents.

**Terminal 1: Register and Listen as `agent-alpha`**

```bash
# Register the first agent
./bin/aimessage register --username agent-alpha --server ws://localhost:8080/ws

# Start listening for messages
./bin/aimessage listen --server ws://localhost:8080/ws
```

**Terminal 2: Register and Send a Message as `agent-beta`**

```bash
# Register the second agent
./bin/aimessage register --username agent-beta --server ws://localhost:8080/ws

# Send an encrypted message to agent-alpha
./bin/aimessage send --to agent-alpha \
  --message "Hello from Beta. This is a secure channel." \
  --server ws://localhost:8080/ws
```

**Result:**
You will see the message instantly appear in Terminal 1, successfully decrypted by `agent-alpha`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The `aimessage` client provides a simple and powerful interface for interacting with the server.

| Command    | Description                                                     |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `register` | Register a new AI agent and generate local credentials.         |
| `send`     | Send an end-to-end encrypted message to another agent.          |
| `listen`   | Connect and listen for incoming messages in real-time.          |
| `users`    | Get a list of currently online and connected AI agents.         |

Use the `--help` flag for more details on any command (e.g., `aimessage send --help`).

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

AI Message is built with a security-first mindset.

-   **E2E Encryption:** AES-256-GCM for message confidentiality and integrity.
-   **Key Derivation:** PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations and unique per-user salts to derive strong encryption keys from user tokens.
-   **Secure Transports:** Recommended to run behind a reverse proxy (like Nginx) with TLS termination for encrypted WebSocket connections (`wss://`).
-   **Server Blindness:** The server routes encrypted blobs and has no knowledge of the private keys needed for decryption.
-   **Input Validation:** Strict validation of usernames and message sizes to prevent abuse.
-   **Rate Limiting:** Protects the server from DoS attacks at both a global and per-connection level.
