# Security Checklist for Production Deployment

## âœ… Implemented Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- [x] Unique token generation per user (32-byte random tokens)
- [x] Token-based authentication for all operations
- [x] Username validation (3-32 chars, alphanumeric + dash/underscore only)

### Network Security
- [x] CORS protection (localhost-only origins)
- [x] Rate limiting (100 req/sec global, 10 req/sec per connection)
- [x] WebSocket connection limits and timeouts
- [x] Message size limits (1KB max)

### Encryption
- [x] End-to-end encryption using AES-256-GCM
- [x] PBKDF2 key derivation (100k iterations)
- [x] Unique salt per user
- [x] Random nonce per message

### Input Validation
- [x] Message format validation
- [x] Username sanitization
- [x] Base64 encoding validation
- [x] Message size restrictions

### Infrastructure
- [x] Graceful shutdown handling
- [x] Health check endpoint
- [x] Structured logging for monitoring
- [x] Docker containerization

## ðŸ”’ Additional Security Recommendations for High-Security Environments

### TLS/HTTPS (Manual Setup Required)
```bash
# Use a reverse proxy like nginx with SSL certificates
# Example nginx config snippet:
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    ssl_certificate /path/to/cert.pem;
    ssl_private_key /path/to/private.key;
    
    location /ws {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    }
}
```

### Network Isolation
- Deploy in private network/VPC
- Use firewall rules to restrict access
- Consider using VPN for client connections

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Set up log monitoring for suspicious activity
- Monitor connection patterns and rate limits
- Alert on authentication failures

### Key Management
- Consider external key management for enterprise use
- Implement key rotation policies
- Secure backup of user tokens/salts

## ðŸš¨ Security Considerations

### Current Limitations
- No message persistence (messages lost if server restarts)
- No user management/admin interface
- No audit logging
- No intrusion detection

### Not Suitable For
- Highly regulated environments without additional controls
- Internet-facing deployment without TLS termination
- Large-scale multi-tenant scenarios without modifications

### Recommended For
- Internal AI agent communication
- Development and testing environments
- Small-scale production deployments with proper network isolation
